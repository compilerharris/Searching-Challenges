Searching Challenge

Have the function SearchingChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your ChallengeToken, and then replace every third character with an X.

Your ChallengeToken: fpk6ou1lb5

Examples
Input: "Hello apple pie"

Final Output: HeXloXpkXouXlbX
